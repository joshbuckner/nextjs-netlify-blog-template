Geralt of Rivia is normally known for carving up monsters, but this new snowboard mod lets him carve something else entirely: the snowy mountains of Skellige, Velen, and Kaer Morhen. Rad.

Called [Geralt VGX Snowboarder](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5373?tab=description), this mod adds a snowboard that Geralt can find at an altar overlooking the bay of Kaer Trolde in Skellige. Interacting with the altar gives you a snowboard that Geralt can equip either as a sword or as boots. The video above shows it in action and, uh, I'm a little surprised by how convincing it looks?

As mod creator Feregorn explains on [its Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5373?tab=description), the snowboard can be equipped as boots in order to ride it, though it looks almost as entertaining to wield it like a sword and bash a Leshy to death with a ten-pound slab of fiberglass.

It's pretty funny to see Geralt whipping around on a snowboard, but this isn't the first time someone had the idea. Back during its development, CD Projekt Red was having a lot of fun with the way Geralt would skid down steep slopes and released [a video of Geralt snowboarding](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-09-heres-the-geralt-snowboarding-demo-cdpr-jokingly-made-during-witcher-3-development) around Kaer Morhen.
